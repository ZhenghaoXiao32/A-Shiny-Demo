# A Shiny Demo: Iris K-means Clustering

## Introduction

This is a demo of R Shiny interactive web-application. The Shiny web-application is aiming at creating a visualization of k-means clustering by using the R built-in Iris dataset. 

## Data

The Iris dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris: Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals in centimeters. Thus, the Iris dataset is a good dataset for demonstrating basic clustering algorithms. 

## K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is a method that partition observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean by minimizing the within-cluster variances.
